# Logarithmic sized proofs of commitment

In a previous chapter, we showed that multiplying the sums of elements of the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ computes the sum of the outer product terms, i.e. $\sum \mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{G}=\sum\mathbf{a}\sum\mathbf{G}$. We also showed that the outer product "contains" the inner product along its main diagonal.

To "extract" the inner product $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle$, one must subtract from the outer product all terms that are not part of the inner product, i.e. the purple shaded region below: 

![off product shade](https://pub-32882f615aa84e4a94e1279ccf3ab85a.r2.dev/bulletproofs-07/off-diagonal-shade.png)

There are $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ such terms, so doing this directly is not efficient.

However, observe that we can "fill up the outer product" in the manner shown in the animation below:

In the animation above, after the prover sends the off-diagonal terms, the prover folds both $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{a}$, reducing their length by half.

At the end, after we have folded $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ $\log n$ times, the size of the vectors is 1. **When $n=1$ the outer product equals the inner product** and we simply reveal both vectors, which will be of constant size.

## Recap -- and how this relates to the previous chapter's algorithm
Previously, we showed how to prove we know the opening to a commitment $P$ while sending $n/2$ elements instead of $n$. As a recap:

The prover commits the vector $\mathbf{a}$ to $P$ as $P = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle$. The prover then sends the off-diagonal terms $L=a_1G_2 + a_3G_4 + \dots a_{n-1}G_n$ and $R = a_2G_1 + a_4G_3 + \dots a_nG_{n-1}$. The verifier responds with $u$ and the prover folds the vector $\mathbf{a}$ over $u$ as $\mathbf{a}'=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{a},u)=[a_1u+a_2u^{-1}, a_3u+a_4u^{-1}, \dots, a_{n-1}u+a_nu^{-1}]$ and sends $\mathbf{a}'$ to the verifier. Since $\mathbf{a}'$ is of length $n/2$, we have cut the size of the data to be transmitted in half.

The verifier then checks that $\langle\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{G},u^{-1}),\mathbf{a}'\rangle\stackrel{?}=Lu^2+P+Ru^{-2}$

The original intent of this algorithm was to prove that we know the commitment to $P$ by showing that we know the sum of the inner product $P$ and the off-diagonal terms $L$ and $R$ equals the sum of the elements of the outer products of the pairwise partitions of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{G}$.

If we recursively apply this algorithm, we get the $\log n$ algorithm described at the beginning of this chapter.

However, we could also interpret this procedure as us proving we know the opening to the commitment $P'$ where $P'=(Lu^2+P+Ru^{-2})$ with respect to the basis vector $\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{G},u^{-1})$ of length $n'=n/2$. We could naÃ¯vely prove we know the opening of $P'$ by sending $\mathbf{a}'$ and the verifier checking that $P'\stackrel{?}=\langle\mathbf{a'},\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{G},u^{-1})\rangle$.

But rather than proving we know the opening to $P'$ by sending $\mathbf{a}'$, we can recursively apply the algorithm to prove we know the opening to $P'$ by sending a vector $\mathbf{a}''$ of size $n/4$. In fact, we can keep recursing until $a^{\prime\dots\prime}$ is of size $n=1$.

The animation below provides an intuition of what is happening. The next section describes the animation in detail.

![iterative commitment animation](https://pub-32882f615aa84e4a94e1279ccf3ab85a.r2.dev/bulletproofs-07/iterative-folding.gif)

For this algorithm to work, the length of the vectors must be a power of two. However, if the length is not a power of two, we can pad the vectors with zeros until the length is a power of two.

## Proving we know the opening to $P$ with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ data
### The algorithm

The prover and verifier agree on a basis vector $\mathbf{G}$ of length $n$. The prover sends the verifier $P$ which is $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle$. The prover wishes to convince the verifier that they know the opening to $P$ while sending only logarithmic-sized data.

The prover and verifier then engage in the following algorithm below. The arguments after the | mean they are only known to the prover.

In the algorithm description below $n$ is the length of the vectors in the input, which are all of the same length.

#### $\texttt{prove_commitments_log}(P, \mathbf{G}, | \mathbf{a})$
##### Case 1: $n = 1$

1. The prover sends $a$ and the verifier checks that $aG \stackrel{?}= P$ and the algorithm ends.

##### Case 2: $n > 1$
1. The prover computes and sends to the verifier $(L, R)$ where

$$\begin{align*}
L &= a_1G_2 + a_3G_4 + \dots a_{n-1}G_n\\
R &= a_2G_1 + a_4G_3 + \dots a_nG_{n-1}
\end{align*}
$$

2. The verifier sends randomness $u$

3. The prover and verifier both compute:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{G}'&=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{G},u^{-1})\\
P' &= Lu^2+P+Ru^{-2}
\end{align*}
$$

4. The prover computes
$$\mathbf{a}'=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{a},u)$$

5. $\texttt{prove_commitments_log}(P', \mathbf{G}', \mathbf{a}')$

### Commentary on the algorithm
The prover is recursively proving that, given values $P$ and $\mathbf{G}$, they know the $\mathbf{a}$ such that $P=\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle$. Both parties recursively fold $\mathbf{G}$ until it is a single point, and the prover recursively folds $\mathbf{a}$ until it is a single point.

The prover transmits a constant amount of data on each iteration, and the recursion will run at most $\log n$ times, so the prover sends $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ data.

We stress that this algorithm is not zero knowledge because in the case $n=1$, the verifier learns the entire vector. The verifier could also send non-random values for $u$ to try to learn something about $\mathbf{a}$.

However, recall that our motivation for this algorithm is to reduce the size of the check $t_u=\langle\mathbf{l}_u,\mathbf{r}_u\rangle$, and $\mathbf{l}_u$ and $\mathbf{r}_u$ were not secret to begin with.

In fact, we have not shown how to prove we know the inner product with logarithmic-sized data, we have only shown that we know the opening to a commitment with a logarithmic-sized data. However, it is straightforward to update our algorithm to show we know the inner product of two vectors, as we will do later in this article.

#### Runtime
The verifier carries out the computation $\mathbf{G}' = \mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{G}, u^{-1})$ $\log n$ times, and the first $\mathsf{fold}$ takes $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. At first glance, it seems that the verifier's runtime is $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, however we should observe that $n$ gets cut in half on each iteration, so the actual runtime is $n + \frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} + ... + 1 = 2n$ so the actual runtime of the verifier is $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

## Proving we know the inner product $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle=v$

We now adjust the algorithm above to prove that we conducted the inner product between two scalar vectors, as opposed to a vector of field elements and a vector of elliptic curve points.

Specifically, we must prove that $P$ holds a commitment to the inner product $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle$. This inner product is a scalar, so we do a normal Pedersen commitment instead of a vector commitment. For this we use a random elliptic curve point (with unknown discrete log) $Q$. Thus, $P = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle Q$.

However, we cannot simply re-use our previous algorithm because the prover can provide multiple openings to $P$. For example, if $\mathbf{a} = [1,2]$ and $\mathbf{b} = [3,4]$, the prover can open also open with vectors $\mathbf{a}' = [3,2]$ and $\mathbf{b}' = [1, 4]$.

To create a *secure* proof of knowledge of an inner product, the prover must also compute and send a commitment $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

The naive solution is to run the commitment algorithm twice. The first to times are to prove $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are properly committed to $P_1 = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle$ and $P_2 =\langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle$ and a third time, to show that $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle Q=P_3$ was properly computed. In the next section, we show how to modify our algorithm to computes the inner product when both vectors are field elements.

### Converting a scalar inner product to a scalar-point inner product

Let $\mathbf{Q}^n$ be the vector $Q$ repeated $n$ times, i.e.

$$\mathbf{Q}^n=[\underbrace{Q,\dots, Q}_n]$$

Thus,

$$\mathbf{b}\circ\mathbf{Q}^n=[b_1Q, b_2Q,\dots,b_nQ]$$

Note that $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle Q$ is equal to $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\circ\mathbf{Q}^n\rangle$.

That is, we can multiply each entry of $\mathbf{b}$ by $Q$ and take the inner product of that vector with $\mathbf{a}$ and the result will be the same as $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle Q$. For example, if $\mathbf{a} = [1,2]$ and $\mathbf{b} = [3,4]$, then $\langle[1,2],[3,4]\rangle Q=(1\cdot 3+2\cdot 4)Q= \langle[1,2],[3Q,4Q]\rangle=1\cdot 3Q+2\cdot 4Q=11Q$.

From there, we could prove the following:
1. $P_1 =\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle$
2. $P_2 =\langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle$
3. $P_3 =\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\circ\mathbf{Q}\rangle$

### One proof instead of three
We can do better than sending three commitments and run the algorithm three times.

Because the points in $\mathbf{G}$, $\mathbf{H}$ and $Q$ have an unknown discrete log relationship, they can be combined as a single commitment $P = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle +\langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle + \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle Q = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$.


We will slightly re-arrange the commitment $P = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle +\langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle + \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle Q$ as $P = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle+\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\circ\mathbf{Q}^n\rangle +\langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle$ to make the next trick more obvious.

To prove this entire commitment at once, instead of three inner products, observe that

$$P=\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle+\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\circ\mathbf{Q}^n\rangle +\langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle=\langle\mathbf{a}\oplus\mathbf{a}\oplus\mathbf{b},\mathbf{G}\oplus\mathbf{Q}^n\oplus\mathbf{H}\rangle$$

where $\oplus$ means vector concatenation.

Effectively, we are proving we committed vector $\mathbf{a}\oplus\mathbf{a}\oplus\mathbf{b}$ to elliptic curve vector basis $\mathbf{G}\oplus\mathbf{Q}^n\oplus\mathbf{H}$.

In practice, we don't *actually* concatenate the vectors because the total length would generally not be a power of two. Rather, we compute the $\mathbf{G}$, $\mathbf{H}$, and $\mathbf{b}\circ\mathbf{Q}^n$ components separately, but compute $L$ and $R$ as if they were concatenated.

We show the algorithm in the animation below:

## The algorithm
Given $v = \langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle$ and commitment $P = vQ+\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{G}\rangle + \langle\mathbf{b},\mathbf{H}\rangle$ we wish to prove that $P$ is committed as claimed. That is, $v$, $\mathbf{a}$, and $\mathbf{b}$ are committed to $P$ and $\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle=v$.

#### $\texttt{prove_commitments_log}(P, \mathbf{G}, \mathbf{H},Q, |\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})$
##### Case 1: $n = 1$

1. The prover sends $(a,b)$ and the verifier checks that $P \stackrel{?}= aG + bH + abQ$ the algorithm ends.

##### Case 2: $n > 1$
1. The prover computes and sends to the verifier $(L, R)$ which are simply the off-diagonal terms of all the vectors concatenated together (see the animation above):

$$\begin{align*}
L &= (a_1b_2 + a_3b_4 + \dots a_{n-1}b_n)Q+(a_1G_2 + a_3G_4 + \dots a_{n-1}G_n)+(b_2H_1 + b_4H_3 + \dots b_nH_{n-1})\\
R &= (a_2b_1 + a_4b_3 + \dots a_nb_{n-1})Q+(a_2G_1 + a_4G_3 + \dots a_nG_{n-1})+(b_1H_2 + b_3H_4 + \dots b_{n-1}H_n)
\end{align*}
$$

2. The verifier sends randomness $u$

3. The prover and verifier both compute:

$$
\begin{align*}
P' &= Lu^2+P+Ru^{-2}\\
\mathbf{G}'&=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{G}, u^{-1})\\
\mathbf{H}'&=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{H}, u)\\\\
\end{align*}
$$

4. The prover computes
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}'&=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{a},u)\\
\mathbf{b}'&=\mathsf{fold}(\mathbf{b},u^{-1})
\end{align*}
$$
